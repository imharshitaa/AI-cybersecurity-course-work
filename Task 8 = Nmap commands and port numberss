--------------Nmap-------------------
Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful open-source network scanning tool that is widely used for network discovery and security auditing. It's a command-line tool that allows you to explore 
network hosts, discover open ports, identify services running on those ports, and perform various network-related tasks. 

Key Features of Nmap:
- Host Discovery: Nmap can quickly scan a range of IP addresses to identify which hosts are online. This is useful for mapping out the live hosts on a network.
- Port Scanning: Nmap excels at port scanning. It can determine which ports on a host are open, closed, or filtered. You can specify different scanning techniques, such as TCP connect scans or SYN scans, 
  to probe target ports.
- Service Detection: Nmap can identify the services running on open ports and determine their versions. This is helpful for assessing the security of specific services and applications.
- OS Fingerprinting: Nmap can attempt to guess the operating system of a target host by analyzing network responses. This helps in tailoring subsequent attacks to the target's OS.
- Scripting Engine: Nmap includes a powerful scripting engine called NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) that allows you to write custom scripts for advanced tasks. These scripts can automate tasks like 
  vulnerability scanning and service enumeration.
- Output Formats: Nmap provides various output formats, including human-readable text, XML, and grepable output, making it versatile for different purposes and integrations.

Common Uses of Nmap:
- Network Discovery: Discover live hosts on a network segment to map out the network's topology.
- Port Scanning: Identify open ports on target systems to assess their attack surface.
- Service Enumeration: Determine the services and versions running on open ports to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- Vulnerability Scanning: Use Nmap scripts or third-party scripts to perform vulnerability scans and detect known security issues.
- Firewall and Security Assessment: Assess the effectiveness of firewalls and security policies by checking which ports are open or filtered.
- Network Auditing: Perform security audits to identify security weaknesses and misconfigurations on networked devices.
- Penetration Testing: Nmap is often used in penetration testing to evaluate the security of systems and networks from an attacker's perspective.
- Network Inventory Management: Maintain an inventory of devices and services running in a networked environment.


--------------Nmap Commands-----------------
1. Basic Host Discovery:
   Command --> nmap -sn [target]
   Description --> Discover live hosts on the network without scanning ports. Useful for network mapping.

2. Scan Specific Ports:
   Command --> nmap -p [ports] [target]
   Description --> Scan specific ports on a target host. Replace [ports] with a comma-separated list of port numbers.

3. Quick Scan with Service Detection:
   Command --> nmap -F -sV [target]
   Description --> Perform a fast scan with service detection to identify open ports and their associated services.

4. OS Fingerprinting: 
   Command --> nmap -O [target]
   Description --> Attempt to identify the operating system of the target host by analyzing network responses.

5. Scripted Scans:
   Command --> nmap --script [script] [target]
   Description --> Execute custom Nmap scripts (e.g., for vulnerability scanning) against the target host.

6. Save Scan Results to File:
   Command --> nmap -oN [filename] [target]
   Description --> Save the scan results in human-readable format to a specified file (replace [filename] with the desired file name).

7. Scan All Ports (Full Port Scan):
   Command: nmap -p- [target]
   Description: Scan all 65,535 ports on the target. Use with caution, as it can take longer and may be more conspicuous.

8. UDP Port Scan:
   Command --> nmap -sU -p [ports] [target]
   Description --> Perform a UDP port scan on the specified ports. Some services use UDP instead of TCP.

9. Scan Multiple Targets:
   Command --> nmap [target1] [target2] ...
   Description --> Scan multiple targets in one command.

10. Exclude Hosts from Scan:
    Command --> nmap --exclude [excluded-host] [target]
    Description --> Exclude a specific host from the scan to avoid scanning it unintentionally.

11. Verbose Output:
    Command --> nmap -v [target]
    Description --> Display detailed verbose output during the scan for debugging and analysis.

12. Aggressive Scan:
    Command --> nmap -A [target]
    Description --> Enable aggressive scanning, which includes OS detection, version detection, and script scanning.

13. Ping Scan (No Port Scan):
    Command --> nmap -sn [target]
    Description --> Perform a ping scan without scanning ports. Quickly checks if hosts are online.

14. Timing Options:
    Command --> nmap -T[0-5] [target]
    Description --> Adjust the scan timing from 0 (paranoid) to 5 (insane). Slower timing is stealthier, while faster timing is more aggressive.

15. Output Formats:
    Command --> nmap -oX [filename.xml] [target]
    Description --> Save scan results in various formats (XML, grepable, etc.) for analysis or integration with other tools.
