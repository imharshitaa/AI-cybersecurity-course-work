------------REPORT LOGS WITH QRADAR------------

Logs are a critical component of any Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, including IBM Security QRadar. QRadar is designed to collect, store, and analyze log and 
event data from various sources across an organization's IT infrastructure. 

1. Log Collection:
QRadar collects log and event data from a wide range of sources, including:
Network devices: Routers, switches, firewalls, and intrusion detection/prevention systems.
Servers: Windows, Linux, Unix, and other operating systems.
Applications: Databases, web servers, and custom applications.
Endpoints: Workstations and servers.
Cloud services: AWS, Azure, and other cloud platforms.
Security appliances: Antivirus, endpoint protection, and email security solutions.
User activities: User login/logout, file access, and other user-related events.

2. Log Sources Configuration:
To collect logs effectively, QRadar needs to be configured to communicate with each log source. This involves setting up log sources within the QRadar console and specifying the necessary 
parameters for each source, such as IP address, log format, and communication method (e.g., syslog, SNMP, or agents).

3. Log Normalization:
Logs collected by QRadar often come in different formats and structures. QRadar's normalization process standardizes these logs into a common format, making it easier to analyze and correlate 
data from various sources.

4. Log Parsing:
After normalization, QRadar parses log data to extract relevant information, such as timestamps, event types, source and destination IP addresses, and user identities. This parsed data is used for 
analysis and correlation.

5. Log Storage:
QRadar stores log data in a secure and scalable storage infrastructure, allowing organizations to retain historical log data for extended periods. This historical data is crucial for forensic 
investigations, compliance reporting, and trend analysis.

6. Real-Time Monitoring:
QRadar continuously monitors incoming log data in real-time. It applies predefined and custom correlation rules to identify patterns or anomalies that may indicate security threats or incidents. 
When a security event is detected, an alert is generated.

7. Alerts and Offenses:
QRadar classifies detected security events and anomalies into offenses, which are prioritized incidents. These offenses trigger alerts and notifications, which can be investigated by security analysts.

8. Investigation and Reporting:
Security analysts use QRadar's interface to investigate alerts, view correlated data, and perform in-depth analysis. QRadar provides reporting and visualization tools to create reports and dashboards for 
compliance, security monitoring, and management visibility.

9. Incident Response:
QRadar supports incident response workflows, allowing organizations to define and automate response actions based on detected threats. This includes containment, isolation, and remediation of affected systems.

10. Integration:
QRadar can be integrated with other security solutions, such as intrusion detection/prevention systems, vulnerability management tools, and threat intelligence feeds, to enhance its capabilities.
